 Bitcoin Brute-forcing private keys time calculator

The probability of cracking a Bitcoin address by randomly guessing private keys is incredibly low. There are 2^256 possible private keys, which is an extremely large number. To put this into perspective, it is estimated that there are around 10^80 atoms in the observable universe. This means that the probability of randomly guessing the correct private key for a Bitcoin address is less than 1 in 10^77.

In other words, it is practically impossible to crack a Bitcoin address by brute force. This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is considered to be secure.
